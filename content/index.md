## 📖 Document Categories

### Language Specification
Documents that define what Phaser is and how it works:
- Grammar and syntax rules
- Type system and semantics  
- [[language/Metaprogramming model|Metaprogramming model]]
- Core language features

### Programming Guide
Documents that show how to use Phaser effectively:

## 🔗 Navigation

The documentation uses Obsidian-style `[[internal links]]` to create an interconnected knowledge graph. You can follow these links to explore related concepts and see how different aspects of the language connect.

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Language Design** goes in `docs/language/` - anything users need to understand Phaser
2. **Implementation Details** go in `docs/contributing/` - anything specific to building the compiler
3. **Use cross-references** with `[[Document Name]]` or `[Document Name](./path/to/doc.md)` syntax
4. **Include examples** to illustrate abstract concepts
5. **Follow the established structure** and naming conventions

## 📊 Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - Phaser is under active development. Documentation may change as the language evolves.

The documentation reflects the current design vision and may include features not yet implemented in the compiler.

**Current Focus:**
- Finalizing language design specifications
- Building compiler implementation documentation
- Creating comprehensive examples and tutorials
